#!/bin/bash

# This script displays a list of all currently running processes
# with detailed information and a visual representation of their
# hierarchy (parent-child relationships).

# Requirements met by this script:
# 1. Show all processes: The 'a' option includes processes for all users.
# 2. Include processes without a TTY: The 'x' option includes processes
#    that are not attached to a terminal.
# 3. Display in a user-oriented format: The 'j' (jobs) and 'f' (forest)
#    options provide human-readable output including USER, PID, %CPU, %MEM,
#    VSZ, RSS, TTY, STAT, START, TIME, and COMMAND.
# 4. Show process hierarchy: The 'f' (forest) option displays an ASCII
#    art process tree, visually representing parent-child relationships
#    using indentation.

# Execute the ps command with the specified options.
# - 'a': Show processes for all users.
# - 'x': Show processes without a controlling tty.
# - 'j': Jobs format.
# - 'f': Forest format (ASCII art process tree).
